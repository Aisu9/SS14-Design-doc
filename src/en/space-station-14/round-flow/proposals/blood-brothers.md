Blood Brothers is a variant of Traitor with a bit of brotherly love! Instead of getting 20 telecrystals and an uplink to do your deeds, you are given a friend! Together you and your new teammate will crush mountains, do the impossible and complete all the regular traitor tasks there is. They have a revolutionary-type-of special icon and **shared objectives**, making team play not just optional but mandatory to achieve that sweet greentext. _Quick note that blood brothers are not related to The Syndicate by any means._

## Spawn conditions
### Traitor gamemode
There is a 50% chance to spawn a single team of 1-3 blood brothers. If there will be only one, he will be given a special one-charge flash to convert a crewmember of his choice, like a head revolutionary. Late join is not an option, unfortunately.
### Blood Brothers gamemode
Blood Brothers are divided into teams and each one is given a one-charge flash. For example, if there are 4 blood brothers, there are 4 individual teams. Late join is possible!

## Objectives
Regarding objectives, Blood Brothers have three main differences:
- You will never get an objective to kill one of your teammates. This also applies to helping with objectives, keeping one alive or whatever objective that is targeted at another BB inside of your team.
- Your objectives are shared. For example, if you or your teammate completes an objective, you both get a greentext.
- The last _mandatory_ objective will be to ensure that the whole team has escaped on the evacuation shuttle alive and unrestrained.

If there are more than 1 team of blood brothers, you may be tasked with destruction of the other team. If they don't get a greentext - you do.
