Blood Brothers is a variant of Traitor where you are bound to work with another random person on the station. Together you and your new one or two friends will work together to pull off any of the regular traitor objectives. Blood Brothers do not have an uplink and are not related to The Syndicate by any means. They also have a _revolutionary-type-of_ special icon to easily identify his teammates.

Blood brothers' goal is to complete all their objectives and escape to CentCom together.

Team play is not just optional but mandatory to achieve that sweet greentext. Shared objectives give a lot of freedom for executing evil deeds.

Consider it a 0TC antag that is focred to keep an eye on his friends and do team play. ~~feelsbadman if your bro is catatonic or ssd~~

## Spawn conditions
In Traitor gamemode, one to three random crewmembers will become blood brothers when giving out antag roles. If there is only one Blood Brother, he will be given a special one charge flash to convert another person to his side.

## Objectives
The blood brothers have 2-3 of your average traitor tasks. They are shared, thus, for example, if you or your teammate completes an objective, you both get a greentext. Besides their regular traitor deeds, they also have a special objective to ensure that all members of the team are alive and unrestrained, which will 100% be a pain to do.

Blood Brothers will never get an objective to kill one of their teammates. This also applies to helping with objectives, keeping one alive or whatever objective that is targeted at another BB.
