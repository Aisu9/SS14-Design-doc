Blood Brothers is a variant of Traitor where you are bound to work with another random person on the station. Together you and some random person will work together to pull off any of the regular traitor objectives.

## Your average average blood bro
The average blood brother:
- Only appears in Traitor rounds
- Does not have an uplink, but knows codewords
- Has a _revolutionary-type-of_ special icon to easily identify his BB

Blood brothers' goal is to complete all their objectives **with no losses** on their side.

The comedic duo has 3-5 of your average traitor objectives. They are shared, thus, for example, if you have a "steal captain's ID card" objective, if you or your blood bro has it in his bag, you both get a greentext. Besides their regular traitor deeds, they also have a special objective to ensure that both are alive and unrestrained. You will also be tasked more often to execute a fellow syndie, so snatch that contraband of his!

Team play is not just optional but mandatory to achieve that sweet greentext. Common/shared objectives give a lot of freedom for executing your evil deeds. ~~heck i can imagine like 6.. no 7... a LOT of ways to hide items already~~

You can consider it a 0TC antag that is focred to keep out on his "friend" and do team play. ~~feelsbadman if your bro is catatonic or ssd~~
