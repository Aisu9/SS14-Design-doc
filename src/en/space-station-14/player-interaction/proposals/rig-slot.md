## Overview

Add an additional inventory slot and adjust the rest of inventory to achieve a more dynamic system. The rig slot is an
upper body parallel to the belt slot. Together, the belt slot and the rig slot form a task-oriented "front inventory"
while changes to back bags form a spacious "back inventory".

## Background

This proposal is contextualized by the state of the game when suit storage was changed to not be provided by coats and jackets.
In my opinion the change was positive, and it inspired some additional thoughts regarding inventory.

This proposal is not a response to this change but some of its concepts are inspired by it.

## The New Slot: The Rig Slot
As previously stated, the rig slot is an upper-body parallel to the belt slot. The belt slot can wear specialized
sub-inventories and in some cases can hang small weapons. Likewise, the rig slot can wear specialized sub-inventories and
in some cases can sling long weapons. Together, their similar roles but unique identities expand the concept of a character's
loadout, forming a two-part "task inventory".

This task inventory varies depending on your job and gameplay goals:
- A 'construction' loadout may feature a material sheet bag in the belt slot and a tool rig in the rig slot.
- A 'salvaging' loadout may feature an ore bag in the belt slot and a salvage rig in the rig slot.
- A 'combat' loadout may feature a grenade belt in the belt slot and a shoulder holster in the rig slot.

By expanding the concept of a task-oriented inventory (in combination with additional proposals below) from single 
supplementary options to capable multi-part loadouts in themselves, role identity is given more to define itself with.
A primary factor of defining role identity right now is *access* to equipment, and in some cases it ends there. Now role 
identity can also be about *capacity* for equipment and their powers.

It comes up sometimes in discussion, what separates a job from another job besides the items on their person. For some
small example I can think of, sometimes when people talk about expeditions and the concept of gathering a varied team
of crew members to fill different roles, its suggested "why dont the salvagers (the current monopolizers on expeditions)
just take the equipment and do the role themselves?"

## Back Bag Changes

The proposal for changes to back bags is that they can no longer be opened while worn. This excludes the satchel, which now has a
small capacity fitting of its form and can be opened while worn.

To state it up front, nothing in design can compare to a spacious, completely generic, effortlessy accessible inventory granted to
every player. These three qualities together complicate any effort to design strong role identity or dynamic inventory-management
decisions. Bags have far too much value centered in one place. 

As a result of bags, supporting utility inventories lack the utility value that they thematically boast, being only small boosts in
specific directions to the players total capacity. Besides localizing a certain type of item in one place on a person, they do little
to present interesting dynamics. Only after something doesnt fit in the bag does it go to players' other options.

As a result of bags, decisions that are intended to be compelling are difficult to justify, like giving up what is nearly your sole
inventory to carry a weapon on your back. Your backpack is far too spacious, universal, and accessible, holding your personal survival
equipment at round start, to match most weapons' value, which in some cases will require additional carried resources like ammo.

With this change to bags, the intended experience is that players will have their most frequently accessed items in their "front inventory",
like a form of cache. Likewise it's also the intention that in some cases, additional resources from their "back inventory" are brought
forward into their cache. For a constuction loadout, they may bring additional materials forward into their cache after a set of repairs.
For a combat loadout, they may bring additional ammo and gear forward into their cache after an encounter.

It is also intended that the changes to bags be as low friction as possible while being enough to set this clear distinction between a
task-oriented accessible inventory and a spacious universal inventory. Holding a bag in a hand or opening it on the ground is not a
massive hurdle, and if players wish to bypass it, they have a dedicated inventory option with the satchel. Many players operate in a
specific spot for an extended period, it might even become natural that they place their bag down once they get to their workstation,
like most would in daily work.

## Supporting Proposals

- Most longarms can no longer fit in back bags at all.
- Most sidearms can no longer fit in pocket slots. (Filed-down pocket-pistols like the cobra would.)
- Restrict suit storage to space suits and to storing oxygen.

Currently if all slots possible were used to carry weapons, assuming
someone had any kind of armor at all, a person could wear 2 long arms and 3 sidearms. Most games follow a rule of "one big one small", and
standard weapon wearing should resemble this.

"One small" could hang in the belt slot and "one large" could sling over the rig or back slot.
Combat-specialized loadouts would even allow this holstering while providing some space for ammo and gear in the holster.
The decision for using a slot to stow a large weapon then becomes:
- Do I sacrifice my generic spacious inventory?
- Do I sacrifice my specialized accessible inventory?
