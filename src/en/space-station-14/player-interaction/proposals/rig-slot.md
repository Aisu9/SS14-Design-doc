## Overview

Add an additional inventory slot and adjust the rest of inventory to achieve a more dynamic system. The rig slot is an upper body parallel to the belt slot. Together, the belt slot and the rig slot form a task-oriented "front inventory" while changes to back bags form a spacious "back inventory".

## Background

This proposal is contextualized by the state of the game when suit storage was changed to not be provided by coats and jackets. In my opinion the change was positive, and it inspired some additional thoughts regarding inventory.

This proposal is not a response to this change but some of its concepts are inspired by it.

## The New Slot: The Rig Slot
As previously stated, the rig slot is an upper-body parallel to the belt slot. Together, their similar roles but unique identities expand the concept of a character's loadout, forming a two-part "task inventory".

This task inventory varies depending on your job and gameplay goals:
- A 'construction' loadout may feature a material sheet bag in the belt slot and a tool rig in the rig slot.
- A 'salvaging' loadout may feature an ore bag in the belt slot and a salvage rig in the rig slot.
- A 'combat' loadout may feature a grenade belt in the belt slot and a shoulder holster in the rig slot.

By expanding the concept of a task-oriented inventory (particularly in combination with additional proposals below) from single supplementary options to capable multi-part loadouts, role identity is given more to define itself with. By letting users mix and match the upper and lower half of their loadout, their role belt does not have to be a catch-all for their needed equipment, their gear does not all have to fit in one place, and characters can mix and match the strenths of their roles.

As an example of the first, for a nuclear operative currently, pistols can fit in the grenadier rig, which thematically is suppose to be a rig where an operative stores their wealth of explosives. Now, the argument that maybe that just shouldnt be the case does not weigh on this proposal, but the point is illustrating that limited loadout customization compels options to reach outside of their niche.

As an example of the second, engineer toolbets can fit pretty much every single tool they could ever need, and this means that any non-engineer who can acquire a widely available toolbelt is nearly as equipped as them. Now, engineers could be given an exclusive super belt that fits more tools than the limited utility belt, but then what is the utility belt? An arbitrarily inferior version? Instead, engineers who really want to carry their full toolset around would equip both parts of the tool loadout, the tool belt and the tool rig, the tool rig perhaps being more limited to their access.

As an example of the third, a combat medic could wear a belt full of medical supplies and stims and a rig to store their weapon of choice. They are not as combat oriented as their allies, but they have both medical and combat powers.

A primary factor of defining role identity right now is access to equipment, and in some cases it can end there. With a greater value in these loadout pieces, role identity can also be about the capacity for the equipment. There are no character skills in the game, so access and ease of handling represents a character's 'proficiency' with gear. To this effect, combat loadouts may possess exclusive access to belts and rigs that can carry their weapons.

It comes up sometimes in discussion, what separates a job from another job besides the items they use. For some small example I can think of, sometimes when people talk about more-open expeditions and the concept of gathering a varied team of crew members to fill different roles, it's suggested "why wouldnt the salvagers (the current monopolizers on expeditions) just take the equipment and do the role themselves?" In this case it would be because their task inventory is oriented towards a different set of goals.

## Back Bag Changes

The proposal for changes to back bags is that they can no longer be opened while worn. This excludes the satchel, which now has a small capacity fitting of its form and can be opened while worn.

To state it up front, nothing in design can compare to a spacious, completely generic, effortlessy accessible inventory granted to every player. These three qualities together complicate any effort to design strong role identity or dynamic inventory-management decisions. Bags have far too much value centered in one place. 

As a result of bags,

- supporting utility inventories lack the utility value that they thematically boast, being only small boosts in specific directions to the players total capacity. Besides localizing a certain type of item in one place on a person, they do little to present interesting dynamics. Only after something doesnt fit in the bag does it go to players' other options, including seldom used storage like coats.

- decisions that are intended to be compelling are difficult to justify, like giving up what is nearly your sole inventory to carry a weapon on your back. Your backpack is far too spacious, universal, and accessible, holding your personal survival equipment at round start, to match most weapons' value, which in some cases will require additional carried resources like ammo.

With this change to bags, the intended experience is that players will have their most frequently accessed items in their "front inventory", like a form of cache. Likewise it's also the intention that in some jobs, additional resources from their "back inventory" are brought forward into their cache between tasks. The intended loop in this regard is that the front inventory defines a character's abilities per task, their back inventory defines a character's total capacity to complete tasks, and so players enter a rythm of completing a task, bringing resources forward a number of times, and then returning to their department to totally refresh.

For a constuction loadout, they may bring additional materials forward into their cache after a repair. After a certain set of repairs, they would go to Engineering or Cargo to restock.

For a combat loadout, they may bring additional ammo and gear forward into their cache after an encounter. After a certain number of violent encounters, they would take time away from danger to restock their arsenal.

It is also intended that the changes to bags be as low friction as possible while being enough to set this clear distinction between a task-oriented accessible inventory and a spacious universal inventory. Holding a bag in a hand or opening it on the ground is not a massive hurdle, and if players wish to bypass it, they have a dedicated inventory option with the satchel. Many players operate in a specific spot for an extended period, it might even become natural that they place their bag down once they get to their workstation, like most would in daily work. If they are instead a job that moves about the station alot, handheld storage options like toolboxes might even get more use, since the experience would be similar to backpacks that you'd already need to put into your hand or place down at your site of work. In this
case, they could tote things and place it down without making their personal belongings 'vulnerable'.

## Supporting Proposals

- Most longarms can no longer fit in back bags at all.
- Most sidearms can no longer fit in pocket slots. (Filed-down pocket-pistols like the cobra would.)
- Remove weapons' ability to be worn like clothes and grant that capacity to combat oriented belts and rigs. (If compensation for loss of crew power is needed, civilian options for slings and holster, with bare minimum capacity, can be added.)
- Restrict suit storage to space suits and to storing oxygen.

Currently if all slots possible were used to carry weapons, assuming someone had any kind of armor at all, a person could wear 2 long arms and 3 sidearms. Many games follow a rule of "one big one small", and standard weapon wearing should resemble this.

"One small" could hang in a worn belt and "one large" could sling on a worn rig. Or you could wear a belt holster and a shoulder holster and take two smalls with you, whatever you want dude. Combat-specialized loadouts would allow this holstering while providing some additional space for ammo and gear in the belt/rig. The decision to wear weapons now explicitly leans a character into being a combat loadout, compromising their other abilities.

Said briefly, the final above proposal to restrict suit storage is because with this new addition, its old niches would be covered, and the slot can focus on a space-faring suit's built-in capacity for an oxygen tank.
