# Core Game Design
These documents contains the Spacestation 14's Core Game Design Princples and should be used to inform the design of any new designs or large balance changes. 

Questions around Core Game Design should be directed towards the Design Group on the Official Spacestation 14 Discord (Prefered) or if you do not use Discord by making a thread on the Spacestation 14 Forums.

### Caveats
- These documents are living documents and will change overtime as the design of Spacestation 14 evolves.
- These documents are one interpretation of what Spacestation 14 should be and only reflects the direction of Wizden (upstream) LRP and MRP servers.
- Forks and other communities may have different ideas and directions which they want to take the game, which is fine and something we want to encourage!
- This is primarily intended to serve as a direction for upstream Spacestation 14 development, but forks can use these design documents as a base if they so choose.
