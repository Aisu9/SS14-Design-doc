# Overview
This design document adds a crafty and fragile ghost role tied to botany.

## Gnome features

 They are a ghost role For early to late round use,
 they have the following abilities and traits:
 - A hand slot to pick up items
 - They can drag items for storage (such as a survival box or backpack) ((dragged items do not follow them under doors))
 - They can be picked up and worn as hats and die when thrown
 - They are healed and revived with glue
 - Gnomes are grown from a Gnome hat that can be planted into a gnome plant that grows the gnome
 - They are very fragile (10 health) but don't need air and are resistant to temperature damage 
 - Being hollow they are weak to pressure changes that cause them to break quickly, space is an instant death.
 - Can be gibbed into a gnome shard and glass to plant another gnome plant
 - Has a gnome accent that replaces all "no" at the start of words to "GNO" and certain past tense words to GNOMED eg: killed > GNOMED (The captain is GNOMED)
 - Weak to blunt, slightly resistant to slash and piercing, and very resistant to burns
 - Rooms can be "Gnome proofed" with mouse traps
 - Gnomes act like a normal garden gnome until possessed by a ghost player

## Gnome Design And Intent 

Gnomes are meant to be a way for players to create more ghost roles for dead players and offer new ways to help the station. 
The intent is for Gnomes to have good utility that leans toward being helpful to the station and to add more variety of content to botany players. 
Gnomes while intended to be happy go lucky helpers have a very large potential for petty crime, this is balanced out in three ways:
 - Very low health, if caught annoying crew or stealing or other activities they can be easily killed by whatever is on hand 
 - No inventory, everything must be held and containers cannot be dragged under doors meaning major theft has to be planned in advance 
 - Cannot use guns 
The idea is one Gnome per hat. being this limited however, it would be simple for a greytide to round remove all of the gnomes. 
gnomes spawning a plantable Gnome hat on death helps prevent gnomes from being removed from the round too easily.
Gnomes also may give a larger incentive to lock lockers so gnomes do not pilfer items.
Gnomes are also grounded in humor, the limitations on them (low health and one hand with no inventory) would inspire ways to work around things. 
They have opportunities for strange gimmicks but not much for anything actively harmful. some examples of this Gremlin embracing idea are: 
hoarding, trading, stealing, fort construction, gnome maints bar, and so on. 

## Special thanks
Here I would like to thank several people that helped get gnomes off the ground:
 - DanOftheE for making the sprites
 - Fey for letting me bounce ideas off them
 - mi$hka for asking me to make gnomes

While I'm responsible for development and design of the Gnomes without them I would have never done any of this.
