# Testing SS14

Testing code is critical to a software application's long-term viability. SS14 is, from a developer's perspective, a complex game with many moving parts; all the more reason to ensure it's well tested. The motivation of this section is to add testing documentation to help streamline the testing process, and minimize redundant questions about basic yet integral testing concepts.

Contributions to this section should seek to elucidate various non-obvious testing concepts, and provide answers to various general "How do I test X?" kinds of questions.
