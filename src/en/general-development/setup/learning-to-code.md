# Learning to Code

While coding is not essential for all contributions in Space Station 14, it is still very important to the game. As such, this guide serves as a roadmap for people who want to begin programming for the purpose of contributing to Space Station 14.

Remember, coding is a skill that can be learned by _anyone_ with enough dedication and practice. Just don't give up.

## Where to Begin

If you are a new programmer (welcome!), there's a plethora of helpful resources that may interest you:

- **[C# A Player's Guide 5th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0985580151)** (Highly recommended)  
  A very engaging book for beginners to C#.
  Very modern, making use of C#10 and .NET 6 with tons of projects and challenges to actually make use of your coding skills.
  Buy whatever the newest edition is (regardless of what this says), as we stay up to date on new .NET and C# versions.

- **[C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/csharp-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners)**  
  A video series covering the absolute basics of programming, C# style.
  This will also walk you through installing the Visual Studio IDE (a code editor which helps you write more and better code) and setting it up.

- **[C# 101 | Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/)**  
  The videos are okay (they skim over terms like "variable", "string", and "interpolation"), but the tutorials themselves are solid.
  If you prefer interactive written tutorials over watching videos, there are many tutorials accessible in your web browser [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/hello-world).

- **Microsoft's various C# guides**  
  For those who already have some experience (meaning you know what "modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language" means), the [getting started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/) gives some basic examples on how to use C# and shows how to use Visual Studio for writing C#.
  The [programming guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/) gives more specific examples of C# language features.

- **[Learn C# in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/csharp/)**  
  Reference sheet presented through a massive C# file.
  This is more useful for those who already understand how to program and just need a quick reference for what the syntax is.

- **[CS50 | Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/weeks/6/)**  
  If you are interested in going deeper into programming, this is a great online course that teaches programming and how computers work.
  It covers a broad swathe of Computer Science topics, and will help you get a better understanding and appreciation for what you're doing.
  This will actually let you talk the talk and walk the walk of programming.

## Developing Your SKills

Once you have a rough grasp of programming, read [SS14 by Example](../../ss14-by-example/introduction-to-ss14-by-example.md). It provides a step-by-step guide to implementing many common things inside Space Station 14, giving you the groundwork to make bigger and more important contributions.

Once you know what you're doing and would like to grow, try looking at the issues marked [Beginner Friendly](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/labels/Beginner%20Friendly) on the Space Station 14 GitHub repository.

## Being Stuck

It is inevitable that during your coding journey you will get stuck. You will not be the only person to get confused or lost, so don't feel discouraged.

The [Discord](https://discord.gg/ss14) is open to people of all skill levels, whether you've never opened a text editor before or you're a professional programmer. Don't feel sky to ask questions in `#howdoicode`!
