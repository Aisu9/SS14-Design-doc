# Setting Up

This guide is supposed to let anyone go from "zero-to-hero" in Space Station 14 Development.

This should hopefully appeal to all contributors and it is highly recommended you go through all the guides even if they do not immediately appear to be applicable to what you want to contribute to.

The more you can do to help maintainers do their job, the more likely they'll help you with yours!
