# Expected Feature Proposal Decorum

{{#template ../../templates/wip.md}}

These guidelines aim to ensure feature proposals submitted are well-developed and help clarify the game's design, as well as for all participants to understand their role.

## Complete Proposals

All feature proposals should be completed and following the appropriate template. This is not a platform for spitballing ideas, but rather to gain a final consensus on your plan.

The feature proposal should go in depth and show that there was a lot of thought put into every part of it.

As proposals are collaborative documents, if there are multiple authors and designers, the primary author should be in brackets and all the other authors and designers should be in italics under the main header. The primary designers take priority over the author of a document.

Additionally, make sure the proposed document conforms to the basic [Core Game Design](../../space-station-14/core-design.md). There should also be sufficient justification to the existence of the proposal.

## Review & Considerations

While not everything is in a feature proposal is going to be implemented in SS14, it still serves as a source of truth when designing other parts of the game. Just the fact that it was approved by maintainers shows that it aligns with what they believe is the game's design.

As well as that, even if you do all the correct steps with the feature proposal, maintainers still have the sole discretion to close or draft any feature proposal at any time.
