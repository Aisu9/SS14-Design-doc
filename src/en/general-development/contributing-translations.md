# Contributing Translations

```admonish danger
The main game **does not** accept translations upstream as they cannot actually be used by players on official servers.

Even though we don't currently support translations, we still make all strings localizable so they can be translated in the future.

If you want to play Space Station 14 in your native language, you will need to fork it, translate all the fluent files, and then host the server.
```

Translating the lobby and the steam page to other languages is relatively easy!

No programming knowledge or special software is required, just an understanding of English and whatever language you're translating to.

```admonish info
This guide is for translators and not regular contributors. Regular contributors should read the [localization guide](../ss14-by-example/fluent-and-localization.md).
```

## Getting Started

Translation of the game is handled via [Weblate](https://weblate.spacestation14.com/). This program provides an easy interface for translators to submit translations. To get started, you can simply sign in with your existing Space Station 14 account.

As a new user, you only have the ability to submit suggestions. These need to be reviewed by another translator before being accepted.

If you want to get full translator permissions (the ability to direct save translations yourself), all you need to do is _ask_ in Discord or on the Forum. There's no real requirements, as long as you show a dedicated interest and proficiency in the language.

If the language you want to translate to doesn't exist yet, also just _ask_. It requires a bit of manual work to set everything up for a new language, so it's only done on request..

## Working Together

Translation requires teamwork and coordination.

If you wanna talk about translation stuff, the best place to do it is the `#translation` channel on our [Discord](https://discord.ss14.io).
