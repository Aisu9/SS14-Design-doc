## Overview

This design doc will outline some new ideas for the pAI item and ghost role. Making them more fun for a player to take them over.

## Background

pAI as of now they are just chatbots that can play music and quickly can become boring for both the pAI and to their owner. Especially if one or both of them does not rp.

This will give pAI's more options of stuff they can do. Thus making them a more convincing option for players to pickup and ghost players to take over.

These are ideas taken from TG


### (Optional) Hologram
pAI's can choose to manifest themselves as a hologram in the world. They will be unable to intaract with the world in any way and can only go a certain small tile radius away. Could be nice to intaract with their owner or attract attention on to their dead owner.

### Able to use right click, inspect id's and health
They will be able to see id's and use right click to see items like anyone else... their camera should allow em.

### AI Laws
Since of all the new power they will now be able to poses I think its fair that they should be effected by the AI rulesets. One made for pAI's

Something like

1: Serve your owner (name).
2: Follow your directives.

or just default

### Intelli-cards
This will allow arteficial lifeforms to be taken out and uploaded to another machine, for now this will just be a synthetic borg mind. But in the future when we have AI you should be able to upload your pai as the brand new AI.

### pAI apps
And the reason I made this design document. pAI application will allow the pAI to access new features! The idea is that the pAI (or the owner) can choose the apps to download to suit their owner. Every app they download will consume space on their limited memory. Which can't be removed after until the pAI is wiped.

Most of these are ported from TG:

**Music Synthesizer**: Instead of being integrated it will be an app.

**Encryption Slot**: Allows the pAI to access into other encrypted channels. By default they have access to common and binery like now. 

**Headset connection**: (replacement to above) Allows the pAI to access into other encrypted channels that their owners headset has access to. This will be ranged so if the owner leaves the pai will eventually lose connection to their headset. [(da bluetooth davice is ready to pear)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHLyacdlrvA)

**Crew Manifest**: Access to the crew manifest (probably preinstalled)

**Atmos Sensor**: Allows the pAI to scan the air, an atmos techs friend. Or a way to communite to your owner about dangerous situations.

**Digital Messenger**: (Needs PDA Messaging) Allows the pAI to access and talk as their owner to the PDA messaging network. Now you can be a personal secretary! Potencially shows a little pAI icon to show to the other person its a pAI talking.

**Internal GPS**: Shows the pAI their cordinates, they will need to relay this information to their owner.

**Chem Scanner**: Similar to the chem googles, useful for chemists.

**More!**: I don't have ideas that are not ported from TG.
