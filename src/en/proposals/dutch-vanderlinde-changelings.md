## Goals

They get a set of objectives like traitors:

-- Kill or maroon a random crewmember. This can be anyone, except for other changelings.
-- Escape alive to central command
-- Escape with identity || An alternative option to the escape alive objective, this requires you to escape alive to central command, be transformed as that person, and have an ID that matches their name.
-- Extract DNA. Requires you to have stolen the DNA of atleast 4-5 crewmembers.
-- Absorb a changeling. You will have to absorb ANY other changeling.

Changelings are not a team antagonist and are not required to work together, but may if they want to.

## Gameplay
While playing as a changeling, your primary focus should be stealth since most abilities support this option, but they do have loud options if need be.
Changelings should be quite hard to permanently get rid of. If you want to get rid of a changeling for good, you'll need to gib or cremate it.

When the round starts, the game selects around 3-7 crewmembers to be a changeling, depending on the population. They are given random objectives.

## Evolution Menu
This menu allows you to 'evolve' to unlock certain abilities, which costs evolution points. Changelings start with 10 evolution points and cannot get more, but if they absorb another changeling they will get 5 more evolution points to spend.

## Chemicals
Chemicals are the 'currency' that is needed to activate most of the changeling's abilities. Chemicals are regenerated at a passive rate at 0.5 a second but this rate may be decreased through use of other abilites. You can have a maximum of 75 chemicals, but that amount can be increased through absorbing humanoids. You do not regenerate chemicals while dead.

## Default Abilites
These abilities are unlocked by default and don't require purchasing from the evolution menu.

Absorb DNA -- When used on a crit/dead humanoid, the changeling will start absorbing the target in stages.

Stage 1: You find out if they're compatible or not
Stage 2: You extend a proboscis
Stage 3: You stab the target with the proboscis
Stage 4: You absorb their DNA which allows you to transform as them. When someone is successfully absorbed, it will give them 200 genetic damage, making them unrevivable. You will also gain an action which allows you reset your abilities, giving you 10 evolution points back but removing all purchased abilites.

Each stage takes 15 seconds to complete.

Regenerate -- When used when the changeling is critical (not dead) it will instantly restore blood volume, remove bleeding, and heal 125 brute and 100 burn (split between all types). Costs 10 chemicals. This will make a loud noise and popup to everyone nearby when used, so don't use it around anyone or they'll know you're a changeling.

Reviving Stasis -- When activated, the changeling will fake its death. After about a minute, the changeling will get an alert which will relieve them of all damage and effects. Costs 15 chemicals and this ability can be used while dead.

Cycle DNA -- Cycles through the changeling's stolen DNA strands. It will give changeling a pop-up saying whose DNA it has selected.

Transform -- The main ability of changelings. When activated, will instantly shift into the appearance of its selected DNA strand for a low cost of 5 chemicals.

## Purchased Abilites
Biodegrade -- Costs 30 chemicals and 2 evolution points. This will instantly melt any restraints such as handcuffs or lockers, aswell as closets/crates (if you are inside). Will leave a pile of acid below the changeling.

Chameleon Skin -- Costs 25 chemicals and 2 evolution points. If the changeling has not moved, they will slowly turn invisible. Can be toggled on and off.

Adrenaline Sacs -- Costs 30 chemicals and 2 evolution points. The changeling will instantly produce special stimulants which increases their speed and makes them recover from stuns a lot faster.

Fleshmend -- Costs 25 chemicals and 2 evolution points. The changeling will heal brute and burn damage at a decent rate.

Mimic Voice -- Slows down chemical regeneration by 25% on activation and 1 evolution points. The changeling will mimic the voice of whoever they enter into the textbox, similar to a voice mask.

Arm Blade -- Costs 20 chemicals and 2 evolution points. Transforms one of the changeling's arm into a grotesque blade made out of bone and flesh. The arm blade deals a large amount of brute damage, aswell as causing serious bleeding.

Void Adaptation	-- Slows down chemical regeneration by 25% when activated and 2 evolution points. This will make the changeling resistant to cold temperatures, low pressure, and a need for oxygen.

Dissonant Shriek -- Costs 20 chemicals and 1 evolution point. The changeling will emit a high-frequency sound which disrupts nearby electronics.

Chitinous Armor	-- Costs 20 chemicals, 1 evolution point, and slows down chemical regeneration by 25%. The changeling will inflate its body into an an all-consuming chitinous mass of armor. Provides a LOT of protection from brute damage, but weak to other sources of damage. The armor slows the changeling down by 35%.

Transformation Sting -- Costs 50 chemicals and 3 evolution points. The victim will suddenly shift their appearance of the changeling's selected DNA strand. There is no way to untransform if you have been stung with this.

Mute Sting -- Costs 20 chemicals and 2 evolution points. Instantly injects 20 units of mute toxin into the victim's bloodstream.

Cryogenic Sting	-- Costs 35 chemicals and 2 evolution points. Instantly injects 45 units of fresium into the victim's bloodstream, causing them to freeze in place. Unlike other stings, this will inform the victim that they have been stung.

False Armblade Sting -- Costs 20 chemicals and 1 evolution point. Mutates the victim's arm into a dull arm blade. Looks just like a real arm blade, so this ability can be used to cause extreme confusion within a crowd. Lasts for 1 minute and 30 seconds after being stung.

Blind Sting -- Costs 25 chemicals and 1 evolution point. Gives the victim blindness for about 10 seconds, and dizziness for 3 minutes.

Extract DNA Sting -- Costs 25 chemicals and 0 evolution points. Will instantly extract the victim's DNA.

Hallucination Sting -- Costs 5 chemicals and 1 evolution points. Instantly injects 30 units of LSD into the victim's bloodstream, causing them have a trip.

## Changeling Stings
When a stinger ability is used, the victim will not be informed they have been stung (for most stings).
Stings cannot be used on other changelings, so if a stinger ability is used on someone and it has no effect; chances are they're a changeling.
