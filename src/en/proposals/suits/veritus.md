# Protective Suits and You [Veritius, Unapproved]

## Suit Tiers

### Softsuits
A softsuit is the minimum possible safe amount of material to keep someone pressurised in space. It has relatively high mobility, but has insignificant protection. Also, because of this minimalist design, it's very compact and can be folded safely into a box.

### Hardsuit
A hardsuit is body armor with the pressurising layer of a softsuit, allowing safe movement in space and protection from the dangers of the void. It has moderate mobility and considerable protection. While slow, movement speed can be improved with the addition of assistor motors that require electric charge. Due to the rigid armor, it takes up significant space and cannot be easily folded.

### Mechs
Mechs are all protection, no speed. They have a lot of armor and provide serious protection, but move very slowly. Additionally, their considerable weight must be carried by electric motors, and so are vulnerable to running out of power or EMP. Also, don't even bother trying to put this thing in a box.

Mechs are probably an actually good place to have modular functionality, at least in my opinion.
