## Overview

Add a new minor antagonist with access to a limited selection of abilities focused around single target incapacitation and stealth.
Directly opposed by the Chaplain, Chapel, Holy water and the Bible.

## Goals

Drink as much blood as possible, become more powerful, reach your full potential.

## Gameplay

Vampires get no equipment, instead they get access to a list of abilities with progression tied to how much blood they have drank (cumulative) along with many benefits over their more mortal crewmates:

- They are indistinguishable from normal crew, provided their fangs are retracted - extending their fangs exposes them when examined
- They cannot eat normal food - only liquids and pills, and only Blood will nourish them.
- They have unnatural strength and claws, dealing 10 slash damage
- They cannot rot or freeze and are immunue to pressure
- They cannot leave the station even with protective equipment, as being exposed to the stars will burn them
- Chaplains are immune to their abilities
- Being hit by, or attempting to pickup a bible will burn the vampire
- Drinking chaplain blood, or being splashed/injected/consuming holy water will burn the vampire
- Entering a coffin will bind the vampire to it.
- While inside a coffin vampires are healed (even from death) requiring their bodies to be destroyed to ensure death
- Upon death if the relevant ability is unlocked and with enough blood remaining - the vampire will be teleported to the coffin they are bound to

## Background

SS13 content, gives the chaplain (and ERT Chaplains) a greater role to play - protecting the station from more supernatural threats.
