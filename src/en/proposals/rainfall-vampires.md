## Overview

Add a new minor antagonist with access to a selection of abilities, mostly focused around evasion, escape and single target incapacitations.
Directly opposed by the Chaplain, Chapel, Holy water and the Bible.

## Goals

Vampires have no goals - other than drinking as much blood as possible. The round end screen will display how much blood they drank in total.

## Gameplay

While playing as a Vampire your primary focus is surviving - its highly unlikely you will be able to conceal your identity for long.  
The injuries you inflict are obvious, you leave evidence of your actions and your mouth will need to be uncovered to feed.

You have no abilities that increase your resistance to damage or conceal your identity, and minimal stealth abilities.

The Vampire's core powerset is focused on evading/escaping capture, disabling a single target to feed upon and limited revival from death.  
To a Vampire, blood is everything - They require it for sustenance, purchasing new abilities and using existing abilities.  
As such a vampire must balance how often they use their abilities - too often and they will be unable to make new purchases.

Should they run out of blood, they will be easy prey for the crew.

Directly countering the Vampire is the Chaplain upon whom Vampire abilities are useless, and their Bible which will greatly injure any Vampire it hits.

## Innate Traits

- Vampires appear - for the most part - to be normal crew, only distinguishable by their fangs being visible when extended.
- They cannot eat solid foods, only liquid and pills
- Immune to freezing
- Immune to barotrauma
- Cannot rot
- Are harmed by interactions with anything Holy (Bibles, Holy Water)
- Cannot leave the station, as they are harmed by starlight

## Blood Drinking
Feeding on the living requires they be restrained or otherwise incapacitated - lest they attempt to escape.  
You are limited by your stomach capacity, which means you can only ingest about 30-50u of blood at a time - roughly a safe amount to take from a healthy victim.  
Fully draining a victim will take ~120 seconds - including breaks to digest your meal - and net you 300 units of blood.

## Heirloom
The heirloom is the vampire's means of purchasing new abilities. Its innately bound to the vampire and cannot be used by others.
Should the vampire lose it, they may summon it to their hand.
