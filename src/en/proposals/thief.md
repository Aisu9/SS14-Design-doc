# Minor Antagonist: Thief
the purpose of this proposal is to add a new minor antagonist to the game, the Thief.
This antagonist's specialty is stealing various items, structures and animals from the station, without resorting to violence or killing. 

## Appearance
This antagonist has a chance to appear in "Traitors" and "Extended" modes, given to new players entering the match. 1 thief may appear for every N players in a match.

When appear, the Thief gains 1 new item, "Pickpocket's Bag", which allows you to choose your play style by giving you starter gear.

## Customizable play style
Inside the Thief's backpack, there are 3 things by default: 
1) Thief's Gloves, which allow you to steal things from people unnoticed
2) x2 Bluespace coupon, which can be converted into certain useful items

When using the bluespace coupon, an interface opens up with the ability to choose from a variety of gear sets. 
One coupon can be spent on one set of equipment. Having the thief have two coupons allows the player to customize their own play style by combining 2 different sets.

Suggested equipment sets for bluespace talons:
| Name   |      Content      |
|----------|:-------------|
| Thief Pinpointer | Includes: A pinpointer that shows the direction to an object of interest to the owner thief. When switched on or off, it selects a random object for which the thief has not yet completed the target. |
| Chameleon's Set | Includes: A set of chameleon clothes. |
| Syndie Set | A kit with tools and personal items, kindly borrowed from an unlucky agent. Includes: Agent ID, syndie-toolbox, syndie-cigarettes, syndie-ball, syndie-soap, syndicate agent's clothes. |
| Sleeper Set | A set for those who like to do things VERY quietly. Includes: a hippo pen, a set of nocturine vials, a nitrous oxide cylinder, a set of syndicate pajamas. |
| Implanter Set | Includes: Subcutaneous storage implant |
| Coward's Set | Includes: 2x Bluespace Emergency Beacon: Usable item: after a 5 second delay, teleports the target to a random locker at the station. |
| ? | Open to new ideas. |

## Thief goals
A thief always has 3 goals. The first two are chosen from the categories below. The last goal is to always return to the Centcomm alive and free.

### Steal the item
The goal is to steal a certain item from the station, and keep it with you by the end of the round.
The target list consists of random objects whose abduction can lead to interesting scenarios. This list can include both easy and extremely difficult targets.
This list should not include items that Traitors require: if they are successfully stolen by a thief, the goal becomes too difficult for the Traitor to accomplish.

## Expected gameplay
Given the restriction on violence, gameplay as a thief involves maximum stealth. The thief evaluates the quests he has received, and chooses 2 sets of items to choose from that can help him best. The thief tries to steal the specified targets stealthily, trying not to get caught. If caught, the thief may not fight. But even the specified list of targets does not allow the security service to execute him or put him permanently in a cell. 

This means that a thief, once released, can always try again.
