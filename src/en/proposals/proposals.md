SS14 Design Introduction
========================

This hackmd book serves to aggregate all currently project managed-approved Space Station 14 upstream design documents for public viewing. Documents in this book are ordered with implemented mechanics first.

If you'd like to become a member of the SS14 design hackmd, you can DM mirrorcult and you may be accepted, assuming you're a known contributor or designer in Discord.

It's recommended that you read the [SS14 Fundamental Design Principles](en/proposals/design-principles.md) document to get a high-level overview before consuming the other documents here, as it'll provide context for why things are the way they are.
