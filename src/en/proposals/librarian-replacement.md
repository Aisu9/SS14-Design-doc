# Replacement of the librarian.



**Authors:** Nancok

## Abstract

Addition of a "Record Keeper" role and merging of the Librarian into Service Worker

## Background

From all the RP roles in the game, librarian may be one of the least interactive of all. While psychologist is encouraged to talk about trauma or issue mental health diagnosis, reporter is supposed to communicate events to the crew and investigate, and zoologist has the job of keeping animals in good shape. Librarian is basically a cashier that doesn't sell anything, both in RP and a mechanical sense.   
ALL RP roles have a reason to exist, a role, Librarian's is to sit in a room nobody visits and do nothing.

No one goes to the library to read either, so even if someone wants to actually do librarian work and be at the counter, you MAY see someone once every 5 rounds tops. The role is pretty much decorative at best. Since literally anyone can host a DnD session in the rare case it happens.
But if someone DOES want to read, they'll just fetch whatever book. Its not like library books have any specific topic that anyone would need help finding.
This makes the role almost an anti-slot which could be filled by literally anyone, specially Service Workers.

"But you can make up your own objectives/make your own fun" Yes, everyone can do that, they don't need a role for it, however.

## Proposed solution

With this i propose merging Librarian into the Service Worker role, give Service Workers all the priviliges and access that the Librarian currently has so they can choose to take the position if they want to.  


For those that like the part about writing stuff down and organizing papers. A record keeper role could be made that is actually intended to do so instead of having a librarian asking for access everywhere to acomplish anything.  
  
**Objectives/Responsabilities**: no forced objectives, but they are overall meant to go around the station and document whatever they feel is important. Researched techs, orders from cargo, current prisoners, recent events, etc. Just anything they feel may be worth remembering.  
Unlike the Reporter, they are not supposed to share it publicly. People may request information to them directly or the Record Keeper may leave information at the library that it deems safe for public reading. Records could also be kept locked in the library where only people with service access could fetch (making being a librarian/service worker more enticing).  
  
**Autorithy**: they may not be denied any information when asked without a good reason, unless the Captain or Head of Security say otherwise. They are otherwise as powerless as any other service worker. In case of service workers in the library, the Record Keeper has final say on what documents the worker can give away and to who.   
  
**Access**: Science, cargo, engineering, medical, botany and service. Not theater access (professionals need to keep their secrets). They will need it to document stuff. But they have no access to security or command, they must ask the command personel if they want to know about anything happening behind those doors.  
  
**Interaction and RP opportunities**:  
- Can work with reporters as a source of information or even enter in conflict by withholding it from them.  
- Would pose an interesting role as an antagonist, being able to access so many kinds of information and using it as an advantage, or simply posing as someone wanting to do their duties while entering other departments.  
- Can help communication between departments, removing the need to constantly yell over commons for any little question. They're still just one person so it isn't like it becomes a be all-end all.
- Can help lawyers and other sec stuff get their facts straight and aid in investigations.  
- May assist other roles like cargo or HoP with keeping tabs on required materials or role changes respectively.  
- Can help engineering keep tabs on what needs fixing, specially with low priority stuff.  
- Can document dead crew (which is pretty useful for a variety of reasons)  
- They could be in charge of securing the previously proposed "financial documents" objective for syndies.
  
The role would probably require a time lock due to the access it has.
