## Overview

Simply put an outline of a potential Station AI role – a Command silicon role that’s in charge of keeping an eye on the station and communications as well as handling doors or potentially other electronics.

## Background

The Station AI is a common and prominent role in the original Space Station 13, so it’s quite reasonable it be considered for Space Station 14. There doesn’t seem to be any formal document on it, this proposal aims to serve as a potential idea for the role and a space for more centralised discussion of the role.

## The Basics

The most basic idea for the AI body is a single immobile core located in a secure location, such as the vault or the AI facilities already present on multiple maps. Due to the main body being immobile, the AI should have the ability to move its viewpoint between the core itself and various cameras across the station to be able to observe the events on it (and not be bored staring at the same room the entire shift).
A new AI core should be able to be assembled, much like a machine frame. It would require a positronic brain or MMI to give it a soul. A fresh AI would start without most of the abilities the “proper” AI has and would need to be manually connected to the relevant servers and devices.

## Abilities

The AI should have access to most if not all doors on the station, being able to operate them with functionality equivalent to the heads’ door remotes.
The AI should also have access to all official channels of radio communication (and PDA messages) and equivalent functionality to most computer boards (it probably shouldn’t by default be able to operate shuttles or artifact scanners, but it should be able to know the station records and be able to monitor crew sensors).
The AI may also be able to interface with various machines on the station, like atmos pumps and such.

## Laws

The AI should be beholden to laws equivalent to those of borgs, maybe with an addition of a safety law 0 requiring it to follow Command or Space Law to make it harder to manipulate.
It should be vulnerable to ion storms and emagging (if the antagonist can get into the defended AI core and somehow manage to open and emag it).

## AI Connector

The AI connector would be a tool that can be linked to an AI core and then used on various machines, servers and doors to allow the AI to interface with them.
Science, Engineering and Command should start with one each of those, coming pre-attached to the AI Core built into the station.

## Disclaimer

This proposal is a draft, serving as a first attempt at the idea to hopefully give grounds to further discussion.
