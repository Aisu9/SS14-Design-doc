# Colony Gamemod [Emogarbage, Unapproved]

"Colony" is a gamemode intended to provide a substantially different gameplay experience while still retaining the majority of the regular game features. It will mainly focus on survival on a procedurally generated planet rather than a traditional station in space.

The goal is to foster players in a more cooperative environment that utilizes our powerful procgen and planet systems to create an experience that's more constructive and has more codependency and player interaction than a typical station gamemode.

## Goal
The goal of the Colony mode is to create an escape beacon while surviving increasingly difficult waves of enemies. To do this, you'll need to work together with your fellow colonists to not only gather essentialy resources but to also fend off invaders.

### Escape Beacon
The escape beacon is the "success" state of the Colony mode. To create it, you'll need to use a special lathe available out the base outpost. To assemble it, you'll need to get several parts that each require high amounts of materials as well as unique items that cannot be found outside of random generation.

### Enemies
While your primary goal is creating the beacon, the main threat the players will face is NPCs. NPCs, taking the form of various alien fauna, spawn in groups around the players' base and attack them. They additionally target important structures like power and can undo precious work if defenses are not created.

As the round progresses, the NPCs ramp up in danger, spawning larger hordes more frequently. This will be tuned to 90 minute rounds, ensuring that players don't become complacent and feel pressured to work on creating the beacon.

## Home Base
Rather than a traditional station setup, Colony will use a unique base map made to accomadate the design changes of the mode. Several departments will have different changes made to them in order to better facilitate the mode.

The base itself will be an rundown outdoor compound surrounded by an electrified fence. This provides a base level of security during the beginning of the round and also a large landmark that people can guide around. The different areas will will have entrances facing the outside (because of our beautiful planet that we wish to show off) and only a few small maintenance areas. The low structural integrity is extremely important, as it helps the NPCs be able to break in quickly and cause damage.

Now for some of the differences in the departments:
### Cargo
- Cargo telepad instead of a shuttle
- Cargo sale palette instead of shuttle
- Limited purchasing list: unable to buy materials and other powerful tools.
- Salvage will just scavenge on the planet
- Roundstart ATVs

### Service
- Ranch area for breeding animals
- No roundstart hydroponics trays; soil patches in an outdoor area
- River for water supply?

### Security
- No large armory
- No armory-locked secfab
- No warden or detective
- Only a single holding cell (no traditional antagonists)

### Medical
- More treatment areas with beds
- Chemvend but no dispensers roundstart
- No more paramedics:0 part of doctors' regular duties will be triaging injured crew members.

### Science
- Essentially artifacts only
- No anomaly generator, but a single APE for "what-ifs."

### Engineering
- Material generators (plasma and uranium fuel) instead of AME or Singulo
- More of a focus on building defenses from NPC waves
- No atmos: planet has perfectly acceptable atmosphere

## Planet Generation
The planet will consist of several different places of interest. These will be the places you have to go in order to gather materials for creating the escape beacon.

### Ore Patches
Ore patches, like the ones found on expeditions, offer a way to get materials. These are pretty common and are a stable source of the materials that are needed in order to fix up the base. The rarer materials (uranium, silver, gold) will be needed to create the beacon.

### Outposts / Huts
These are small static structures that contain a random assortment of loot. From weapons to tech disks to armor, these have some minor goodies that are worthwhile to bring back to the station. These will be semi-rare and scattered around the map.

### Ruins / Dungeons
These are the largest structures and the most dangerous as well. Inhabited by swarms of enemies, they serve as gatekeepers for the most rare materials needed for the escape beacon. They will require large groups of different jobs to team up together in order to be able to conquer them. They should also have respawning enemies so they do not thin out from picking off from afar.
