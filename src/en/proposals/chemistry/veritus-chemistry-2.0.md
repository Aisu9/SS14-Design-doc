# Chemistry 2.0 [Veritius, Unapproved, WIP]

## the main idea
Chemistry, at the moment, is shallow and basically a button pressing simulator.
My current plan is to make many chems available from at least two sources, like nitrogen being available from Botany and Atmospherics, and water from... fucking everywhere.

Chemistry should also be made to be more complex. At the moment, it's an extremely simple 'add this thing to other thing in bucket get different thing' system. Injecting a bit of real-life chemistry rules (in moderation, too much realism is not fun) could really spice up the system. 

Also removing the chem dispenser because an infinite supply of anything that doesn't require at least some human interaction is awful.

### machines n stuff
#### Condenser
Machine that turns atmos gas into reagents.

## flowchart
I'm currently mapping out all chemistry interactions to make sure everything gets at least 2 sources. Ask me because it's a drawio file and I can't attach it here.
