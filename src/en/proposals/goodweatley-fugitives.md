# Fugitives [Goodwheatley, Unapproved]

Fugitives are a soft port of the titular event from SS13, with some changes to make the event feel more interesting and replayable.

## Mechanics

Each Fugitive event is made up of two teams, the Fugitives and the Hunters. The Fugitives will arrive on the station unannounced when the event starts, somewhere in the maintenance network. The Hunters will arrive a few minutes later, docking in their custom shuttle. The goal of the Fugitives is to evade capture by the Hunters and escape on the emergency shuttle alive, while the goal of the Hunters is to capture or kill the Fugitives and lock them up in the Hunters' shuttle. 

An important part of this is that each team's objectives don't relate to the crew at all, and each team is explicitly told they can't harm the crew unless necessary; instead of there being clearly defined good and bad guys like with other antagonists, the crew can choose who they want to help. This can lead to much more interesting social interactions for everyone involved.

When the event starts, the type of Fugitives and Hunters are randomly selected. Due to the expanded selection of teams available, the number of possible combinations skyrockets, which helps every Fugitive event feel unique to watch and play.
