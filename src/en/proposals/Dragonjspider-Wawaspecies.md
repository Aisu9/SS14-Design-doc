## Overview
This proposal's plan is to add Scugs as a playable roundstart species, like lizards or humans. While that is our main goal, if the option is presented instead, a ghost role for them would be nice as well.
This doc will go into detail about their stats and abilities, and discussing the possible impacts some of these may have in different scenarios.
Feedback would be greatly appreciated, as there are also some experimental ideas that may be unbalanced, or unfun to play around.

## Background
We have discussed this a lot on the discord, leading to this preposal (starting from https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/1212937078153805844/1220355368228618310), there has been a lot of ideas behind this, and there may be some that was looked over.
Feel free to read all of that, but this doc will also summurize what is agreed to be good ideas, as well as the more experimental/system effecting changes. We also understand that there may be some copyright issues with this, so I will attatch any permissions to this as well. If any are given.

## Copyright permissions
Currently we have permission from a dev of Downpour, expeditions specifically, and we realise this isn't proper approval, more of a semi-approval, but these at least cover a few bases and gives a bit more context.

## Species
Our Official name for the species would be Wawa (proposed by fairlysadpanda), I realise this isn't exactly "creative" for them, so this is more filler than anything. We're not going to be naming them Scug(s), or Slugcat(s), because of more specific issues with copyright and such.
For personalization, they will be able to have any color for skin, similar to lizards or moths.
Anything unmentioned will be similar to humans, like having two hands or a backpack slot.

The conventional naming scheme for them, while mostly a suggestion, would be as follows: Number, Object. E.G: Seven-Hundred Nukies, Twenty-Eight Wounds, Seventy-Three Bombs. (suggested by kiterny)
Alternatively, they could use a single word describing their character, similar to how players name lizards do, but I felt this might make them too similar in character to lizards. 
Or finally, it could be pet names, which may be too far off what would normally be acceptable, but may be considered for names. (because of course people would name these things silly names and stuff)

## Abilities
They will deal additional piercing damage with spears (+4 damage with spears) (suggested by thecatbastard, cornerdogs, dragonjspider)
The following is the time it would take to crit a human with no resists: 

* 1h spear: 12 > 16 : Crits in 9 vs 7 
* 2h spear: 16 > 20 : Crits in 7 vs 5 
* 1h Reinforced spear: 15 > 19 : Crits in 7 vs 6
* 2h Reinforced spear: 19 > 23 : Crits in 6 vs 5 
* 1h Plasma spear: 18 > 22 : Crits in 6 vs 5
* 2h Plasma spear: 22 > 26 : Crits in 5 vs 4 
* 1h Uranium spear: 18 > 22 : Crits in 6 vs 5
* 2h Uranium spear: 22 > 26 : Crits in 5 vs 4

* They will be small in size, similar to dwarfs, making them easier to shove down than other species.
* They will take 20% additional damage from pierce, making Scug vs Scug combat even more lethal, and encourages a nimble playstyle rather than running face first into a gunfight.
* They will have 10% resist to either blunt or slash, undecided. (suggested by piksqu, vytian, thecatbastard, dragonjspider)
* They will be able to run under tables freely, but not under doors, windoors, or plastic flaps. (suggested by thecatbastard, piksqu, vytian)


# Optional/experimental abilities
This section will go over ideas that may be too strong, difficult to code, or other various reasons.

* Once dead, they will have a 30 minute respawn time, respawning at the last bed they slept in. (suggested by erisws)
* Maybe during crit, they could have a very small amount of asphyx, but slowly regenerate brute naturally. (suggested by vytian) Something like "reverse slimes"
* They can have the ability to freely move around in disposals. (suggested by erisws) This would require massive changes to how the disposals work, and may be too far out of scope for a single species.
* They can deal additional damage from thrown items. (suggested by thecatbastard, cornerdogs)
* They can climb into disposals faster. (suggested by cornerdogs)
* They can have some changes in diet, the same potentially not being able to eat meat, but fruit and vegitables. (suggested by dragonjspider)
* They can probably take more damage from caustic. (suggested by cornerdogs) but this was considered too niche, and possibly feature bloat.
* They could have a storage implant Esque ability, limited to small or tiny items. (suggested by dragonjspider)
* They could also take damage from mouse traps, dealing 30 brute damage to them, this way you can try to keep them from going under tables you don't want them under. (suggested by piksqu)
