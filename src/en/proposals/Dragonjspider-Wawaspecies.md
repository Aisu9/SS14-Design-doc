## Overview
This proposal's plan is to add Scugs as a playable roundstart species, like lizards or humans. While that is our main goal, if the option is presented instead, a ghost role for them would be nice as well.
This doc will go into detail about their stats and abilities, and discussing the possible impacts some of these may have in different scenarios.
Feedback would be greatly appreciated, as there are also some experimental ideas that may be unbalanced, or unfun to play around.

## Background
We have discussed this a lot on the discord, leading to this preposal (starting from https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/1212937078153805844/1220355368228618310), there has been a lot of ideas behind this, and there may be some that was looked over.
Feel free to read all of that, but this doc will also summurize what is agreed to be good ideas, as well as the more experimental/system effecting changes. We also understand that there may be some copyright issues with this, so I will attatch any permissions to this as well. If any are given.

## Copyright permissions
Currently we have permission from a dev of Downpour, expeditions specifically, and we realise this isn't 100% confirmation, but this at least covers a few bases.

## Species
Our Official name for the species would be Wawa (proposed by fairlysadpanda), I realise this isn't exactly "creative" for them, so this is more filler than anything. We're not going to be naming them Scug(s), or Slugcat(s), because of more specific issues with copyright and such.
For personalization, they will be able to have any color for skin, similar to lizards or moths.

Anything unmentioned will be similar to humans, like having two hands or a backpack slot.

## Abilities
They will deal additional piercing damage with spears (+4 damage with spears)
The following is the time it would take to crit a human with no resists: 

1h spear: 12 > 16 : Crits in 9 vs 7 
2h spear: 16 > 20 : Crits in 7 vs 5 
1h Reinforced spear: 15 > 19 : Crits in 7 vs 6
2h Reinforced spear: 19 > 23 : Crits in 6 vs 5 
1h Plasma spear: 18 > 22 : Crits in 6 vs 5
2h Plasma spear: 22 > 26 : Crits in 5 vs 4 
1h Uranium spear: 18 > 22 : Crits in 6 vs 5
2h Uranium spear: 22 > 26 : Crits in 5 vs 4

They will take 20% additional damage from caustic and
