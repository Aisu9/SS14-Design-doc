## Overview
The Controller Brain is a mid-round conversion antagonist. Mechanically, it's a mix of blood cult, AI, and revenants. Thematically, it's a body horror twisted flesh sort of thing combined with a psychic apex predator beyond comprehension. 

## Background
TODO

## Mechanics
### Spawning
The Controller Brain can spawn as a random event, similar to space dragons or revenants. They only spawn in secluded areas like maintenance where people are not likely to frequent to prevent people stumbling across them while they're starting out.

It can also spawn (incredibly low chance) when you give cognizine to a humanoid that already has a soul. They will then become an antagonist with the objective of finding somewhere secluded to 'gestate', where they will become a Controller Brain.

### Biomass
The Controller Brain can collect biomass from corpses and non-sentient beings to gain additional abilities from a store, like revenants.

See the Abilities section for more.

### Enthrallment
The Controller Brain can enthrall (convert) crew, making them act in the Controller Brain's interests. This can happen over any distance, but happens faster the closer the target is.

Enthralled crew get a unique radio channel, letting them communicate secretly with the Controller Brain and other thralls. Controller Brain-aligned characters can also see whether a person is enthralled or not.

Thralls can be "cured" with a mindshield implant. This also makes Command and Security start out immune to conversion, though this can change (see the Overpower ability). Thralls are cured if the Controller Brain is destroyed.

### Vision
The Controller Brain can see through its thralls and pylons, much like AIs and cameras.

### Structures
The Controller Brain can create static objects to spread its object and enforce its will.

#### Flesh Pylon
When targeted abilities are used (like the Enthrall ability), distance calculations take the minimum distance between the target, the Brain, and its pylons.

## Abilities
The Controller Brain gets a number of abilities to influence the world.

### Enthrall
The Controller Brain starts with this ability. On use, makes a sentient being your ally. This does not work on creatures with mindshields. This works over any distance, but takes some time, working faster the closer the target is.

See the Enthrallment section to see how thralls work.

### Influence
Costs 10 biomass to unlock. Allows you to send a subtle message to any crew member on board. Mindshielded people are immune.

This ability is RP-focused. I don't imagine it being remotely useful in LRP, but it could be pretty fun in higher role-play levels.

### Translocate
Costs 70 biomass to unlock, and 20 per use. Creates a temporary two-way portal between any two points in the Brain's vision.

### Mutate
Costs 70 biomass to unlock, and 15 per use. This makes the target Thrall tougher and faster, but they will show outward symptoms of being a thrall.

If they cease to be a thrall, they will no longer have the buffs granted to them.

This ability is for when you're discovered and you need a few guys to defend you.

### Divide
Costs 100 biomass to unlock, and 30 biomass per use. Spawns a small flesh bud that your thralls can take and plant somewhere to spread your influence, creating a flesh pylon. See the Pylons section in Mechanics for more.

### Overpower
Costs 100 biomass to unlock, and 30 biomass per use. Only works when the target is in close proximity to the Brain. Breaks a mindshield, but does not convert the person. The person will be made aware that their mindshield is broken.

This ability is for converting "trustworthy" personnel and installing them as your sleeper agents. It's especially good if you get someone like the Captain as one of your agents.

See the Gameplay Implications section for a bit more on this.

### Ascend
Costs 1000 biomass to unlock, and using it is free. Begins a countdown to enthrall **the entire crew.** The entire crew is given a persistent marker on their HUD pointing to the Brain.

The intended goal of this ability is for when you think you're too powerful to stop and want to convert the rest of the crew in one fell swoop. Alternatively, if you've been stealthy this entire time, this is a pretty good way to catch the crew unattended, as long as you can defend yourself.

## Victory
The Brain wins if it can convert all crew. This can be done through simply using Enthrall, or using Ascend.

## Gameplay Implications
### Mindshields
Mindshields are no longer perfect. If a Controller Brain wants to spend the resources to do it, they can break them. This makes the Brain a little more terrifying, because its thralls really could be anyone.

## Minutiae
### Interaction with revolutionaries
If a revolutionary is enthralled, their allegiance lies solely with the Controller Brain. If the Brain is killed, they will revert to normal, non-revolutionary crew.

If a head revolutionary is enthralled, their allegiance lies with the Brain. If the Brain is killed, they will revert to normal, returning their old objectives and allies.

If the character has IC knowledge of the Brain and knowledge a headrev is enthralled, they can choose to ignore the headrev's orders, but should still keep up the goals of the revolution. Killing the Brain is probably a priority for them, though.
