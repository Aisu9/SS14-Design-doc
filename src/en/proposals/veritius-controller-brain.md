## Overview
The Controller Brain is a minor mid-round conversion antagonist focused on converting the crew and taking over the station.

## Mechanics
### Spawning
The Controller Brain can spawn as a random event, similar to space dragons or revenants. They only spawn in secluded areas like maintenance where people are not likely to frequent to prevent people stumbling across them while they're starting out. The Controller Brain is immobile. Wherever you spawn is where you're going to be.

When the Controller Brain spawns, one or two (or more, depending on population) non-mindshielded characters immediately become thralls.

**TODO: What happens if the initial thralls die or something?**

### Enthrallment
The Controller Brain can enthrall (convert) crew, making them act in the Controller Brain's interests. This can happen through the Enthrall ability.

The goal of thralls is to abduct people and bring them back to the Brain for conversion.

Enthralled crew get a unique radio channel, letting them communicate secretly with the Controller Brain and other thralls. Controller Brain-aligned characters can also see whether a person is enthralled or not.

Thralls can be "cured" with a mindshield implant. This also makes Command and Security start out immune to conversion, though this can change (see the Overpower ability). Thralls are cured if the Controller Brain is destroyed.

## Abilities
The Controller Brain gets a number of abilities to influence the world.
These abilities can be purchased through Brain Points™ (don't call it that) which are gained by enthralling crew.
Your average crewmember gives 40 Brain Points™ (may change this)

### Enthrall
The Controller Brain starts with this ability. On use, makes a sentient being your ally. This does not work on creatures with mindshields.
See the Enthrallment section to see how thralls work.

### Influence
Costs 30 points to unlock. Allows you to send a subtle message to any crew member on board. Mindshielded people are immune.

This ability is RP-focused. I don't imagine it being remotely useful in LRP, but it could be pretty fun in higher role-play levels.

### Mutate
Costs 70 points to unlock, and 30 per use. This makes the target Thrall tougher and faster, but they will show outward symptoms of being a thrall. (TODO: What symptoms?)
Mutated thralls also get a 'venom gland' action that injects nocturine into a target.

If they cease to be a thrall, they will no longer have the buffs granted to them.

### Overpower
Costs 100 points to unlock, and 30 points per use. Only works when the target is in close proximity to the Brain. Breaks a mindshield, but does not convert the person. The person will be made aware that their mindshield is broken.

This ability is for converting "trustworthy" personnel and installing them as your sleeper agents. It's especially good if you get someone like the Captain as one of your agents.

See the Gameplay Implications section for a bit more on this.

### Ascend
Costs 1000 points to unlock, and using it is free. Begins a countdown to enthrall **the entire crew.** The entire crew is given a persistent marker on their HUD pointing to the Brain.

The intended goal of this ability is for when you think you're too powerful to stop and want to convert the rest of the crew in one fell swoop. Alternatively, if you've been stealthy this entire time, this is a pretty good way to catch the crew unattended, as long as you can defend yourself.

## Victory
The Brain wins if it can convert all crew. This can be done through simply using Enthrall, or using Ascend.

## Gameplay Implications
### Mindshields
Mindshields are no longer perfect. If a Controller Brain wants to spend the resources to do it, they can break them. This makes the Brain a little more terrifying, because its thralls really could be anyone.

## Minutiae
### Interaction with revolutionaries
If a revolutionary is enthralled, their allegiance lies solely with the Controller Brain. If the Brain is killed, they will revert to normal, non-revolutionary crew.

If a head revolutionary is enthralled, their allegiance lies with the Brain. If the Brain is killed, they will revert to normal, returning their old objectives and allies.

If the character has IC knowledge of the Brain and knowledge a headrev is enthralled, they can choose to ignore the headrev's orders, but should still keep up the goals of the revolution. Killing the Brain is probably a priority for them, though.
