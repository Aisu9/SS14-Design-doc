## Overview

Make guns stronger for syndicate members with pistols while keeping guns roughly the same for nukies. This makes guns more viable for traitors while preventing nukies from always stomping the station.

## Background

This table shows the current balance of weapons available from the syndicate uplink:

| Gun           | Damage/Shot | Shots | Total Damage | Fire Rate | DPS   | Shots to Crit Urist | Number Urists | Shots to Crit Secoff | Number Secoffs |
|---------------|-------------|-------|--------------|-----------|-------|---------------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Surplus Rifle | 19          | 10    | 190          | 0.75      | 14.25 | 6                   | 1             |                      |                |

| Sniper Bundle | 40          | 5     | 200          | 0.75      | 30    | 3                   | 1             | 3                    | 1              |

| L6 Saw Bundle | 19          | 101   | 1919         | 8         | 152   | 6                   | 16            |                      |                |

The data shows that most of the pistols only have enough ammo to down about one unarmoured victim. This creates a situation where typical guns (pistols) available to traitors are too weak, resulting in:

- Players rushing the gun user because they know there's not enough ammo to kill, instead of hiding/fleeing
- Players using guns always need to "magdump" to get anything done
- No gun strategy, just always rush instead of hiding/looking for cover, saving ammo, etc.

On the other hand, the higher-priced weapons available to nukies feel like they're already in a reasonable spot, and so the tricky part is balancing pistols without making nukies stronger.

## Goal

Make weapons like pistols a bit more scary, so that syndicates and security officers can use them more effectively. Pistols should probably be scary enough that a reasonable unarmed player flees or hides, and for security officers to dodge/take cover.

On the other hand, it's also important to maintain more or less the current status for nukie weapons to prevent nukies from always stomping the station. In other words, making the pistols stronger shouldn't also make the machine guns stronger.

## Proposal

1. Make pistols and machine guns take separate ammo, so that their damage values can be balanced separately.

   - Other mechanisms like increasing damage depending on the gun were considered, but that probably leads to the "too many variables to balance" problem.

2. Increase pistol damage across the board to crit in 3-ish shots.

3. Reduce pistol fire rate to maintain same or less DPS.

4. Increase sniper damage to crit in 1-2 shots.
