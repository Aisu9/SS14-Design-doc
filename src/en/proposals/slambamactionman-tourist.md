## Overview

**The Tourist** is a mid-round ghost role with benign, non-antagonistic objectives, visiting the station on a holiday trip. To fulfill their objectives, the Tourist will require crew/departments to do things that could be exploited by other antagonists; being let into secure areas, hold important items, and flash photography crew with their camera. The Tourist essentially provides a low-risk passenger role that is harmless to the station and enables roleplay, but its mere existence enables antags to use the role as a cover story.

## Background

This proposal originates from this [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/1193309894879744151) by yourpaldeebs.

In the current state of the game, many antag roles can be identified by metagame aspects that can only be explained by them being an antag. Examples of this are Terminators appearing in the station without ID & job, StealthOps Nukies/infiltrator Syndicates not appearing on the crew manifest, and hearing a flash basically anywhere that is not right next to Security. This can make these playstyles very difficult against powergaming players and thus quite limiting; the Tourist role is meant to remedy that.

For the Tourist player themself, the role is meant to provide excellent opportunities for roleplay and also add a bit of cheeky yet ultimately harmless spice to the station. The Tourist is *not* an antag. Instead their goals are meant to push for social interactions with crew in a low-stakes environment for the player. The Tourist also appropriately fits into the Standard Operating Procedure that visitors to the station are meant to be welcome.

## Gameplay

The Tourist spawns with a randomly generated name and appearance in a small pod in a random location in orbit around the station. 
This pod contains the following:
- A ClothesMate and AutoDrobe for cosmetic/roleplay options.
- An emergency EVA suit with a small jetpack for traversal to the station.
- A map/station tracker to let the Tourist know which way to travel to reach the station.
- A Camera, a Tourist-exclusive objective item described further below.
- A pair of Sunglasses.

The Tourist does not spawn with an ID/PDA and does not start with a headset. The pod is unable to travel on its own and should only act as an initial spawn location that neither the Tourist or Crew has any reason visit again.

The Tourist gets assigned some amount of objectives from the list below, some of them with multiple targets:

- **Visit:** The Tourist must have visited certain locations on the station. This could be certain departments (Security, Engineering) or specific sub-areas in low-security deparments (Morgue, Cargo Bay, Robotics).
- **Get Drunk in Bar:** The Tourist must have gotten drunk in the bar. Like Visit but with an extra objective.
- **Photograph:** The Tourist must have used their Camera item on a randomly selected crewmember. Camera described further below.
- **Photograph Holding:** The Tourist must have used their Camera item on a specific Command job member while they're holding an item. This is tied to the job listed on the ID to avoid issues where a certain Command member goes SSD or is killed. An example is "Captain holding their Hat" or "Research Director holding an Anamoly Scanner".
- **Stamp Collecting:** The Tourist must end the round with a paper in their inventory that has X different job stamps. Generic stamps such as Approved/Denied do not count, but non-Command jobs such as Chaplain, Clown or Syndicate do.
- **Eat:** The Tourist must have eaten a specific kind of dish. This dish should not rely on too exotic/unreliable ingredients (Carps/Spiders/Xeno/Amanita) but still require effort from the Chef (certain burgers, pies, pancakes and cakes). Only available if a Chef is on the station.

### Travel Camera

The Travel Camera is a Tourist-exclusive item that they spawn with. Its main functionality is to help fulfill the Photograph objective, however it can also be used as a minor defensive tool should the Tourist be at risk of harm. 

The Travel Camera acts very similar to a Flash, however it does not have an AoE mode and contains 10 charges. The Travel Camera can not be refilled (you only brought a single roll!), so Tourists are discouraged from spamming it and to instead use it to fulfill their objective, with any leftover uses being free for roleplay/defense.

The Travel Camera is also a cosmetic item, in that it can be equipped in the tie slot to hang around the Tourist's neck.

The Travel Camera is also rare maintenance loot and available in the Syndicate Uplink, to ensure that it can not be used as a way to verify whether someone is a normal Tourist or not. The uplink Camera is the same as a maintenance/Tourist camera, unlike the Flash Lantern which can be identified and confiscated. The Camera can NOT be used by Head Revs to convert crew.

## Additional Changes

HoP will have a new job role available to them: Visitor. The Visitor has the same access rights as a Passenger (Maintenance), but with a different job icon. This keeps them distinct from Passengers (useful for Command and crew). The Visitor job role can also be used by admins for events.

## Possible Expansions

The Tourist could in the future be split into multiple different kinds of Tourists that have more specificity/theme to their objectives; food bloggers, station inspectors, springbreak groups, veterans. For now, the ClothesMate/AutoDrobe allow the player to choose their flavor of roleplay instead.

The Camera item could also be made to print out photos when one is taken.
