## Overview
Celestial War is a team-based conversion antag with a unique communication structure between players.
Each team, called a church, is made up of three distinct roles:
- A **God**, an omnipresent and invisible observer who directs the church from above, confirms new members, and aids their followers with special abilities.
- A **Prophet**, who can receive messages from their God and can craft altars, tomes, and monuments.
- **Disciples**, who are converted from regular crew by Prophets and serve only to follow the word of the Prophet and please their God,

A round of Celestial War consists of 3-6 churches, each growing, battling, and accomplishing various tasks in order to increase their God's power, to a point where they can ascend and purge the other churches.

### Lore
There existed ten celestial gods who occupied the space of the old Earth.
Their strength was unmatched, fueled by the power of the humans in the far past.
Across endless millennia, in their timeless omnipotence, they waged endless wars stretching across the stars.
As humanity has moved into space, their power has weakened and they have faded.

Until now, as the Gods set their sights on Space Station 14. 
They will choose their prophets and engage in war renewed; not just for space, but for the minds and hearts of man.
Each God wishes to spread their ways and become dominant over the station, giving them renewed power with a growing base of followers.

## Round Flow
Each round begins with 3-6 players spawning as Gods together in a circle.
They are given a few minutes to observe the crew and for them to insult each other and talk shit, in earnest competitive spirit.
Their presence is entirely undetectable and they are incapable of harming one another or affecting the station below.

After this grace period, each God unlocks the ability to choose a prophet.
Gods can choose any **non-Mindshielded** crew member to become their prophet, however, they are free to observe for any period of time in order to ensure that their choice is of sufficient skill.
Their choice will be engulfed in light before being granted the gifts of a prophet: the robes of their god, a grimoire, a single artifact, and bright glowing eyes alongside limited divine powers.

At this point, the prophet has only one goal: to please their God and grow their church.
This is accomplished by performing various tasks and sacrifices (_varying by God_) in order to increase their God's power.
The generated power can then be used for various abilities as well as inducting new members into the church.
The God can use their limited communication to inform their prophet of incoming threats or possible vulnerabilities in other churches.
Churches are encouraged to battle and fight each other, in order to interrupt the other's progress and waste their resources.

a the church has grown large enough, they can begin the **ascension ritual**. 
This requires a monument to be constructed out of steel and an appropriate grimoire be used to bless it.
Once enough disciples have gathered around the monument, the ritual can begin.
This serves as a final stand, requiring the disciples to pray in radius of the monument in order to ascend their god out of its weakened state.
The beginning of the ritual is announced station wide and all disciples of the church gain glowing eyes, instantly ousting them.

The round ends once one of the churches on-station have successfully completed the ritual, at which point the other gods are cast from the boundary of the mortal realm and their followers are obliterated in an extended rapture sequence.

## Followers
_Followers are the players that make up individual churches. They are split between Prophets and Disciples and function as full antagonists._

### Disciples
**Disciples** form the majority of members of each individual church.
They are inducted by the Prophet and serve as the more "common" member of the church.
They have fewer abilities than the Prophet but also are much larger in number, allowing them to battle and accomplish tasks more effectively.

Disciples have extremely limited features.
Their primary aspect is being able to channel their God, allowing the God to grant them blessings, punishments, and to perform divine feats around them.
Additionally, disciples can create altars and monuments, bless structures and players with a grimoire, and preach in order to power their God.

Disciples can be severed from their God if they are blessed with another church's grimoire or the chaplain's bible.
At this point, they will lose their connection and powers and revert back to being a normal crew member.

### Prophets
**Prophets** function as more advanced disciples with a more direct connection to their God.
There is only one prophet per church, but they possess significantly more powerful abilities than the regular disciples.
In the beginning of a round, they are the workhorses of the church, but their true purpose is that of the mastermind, synthesizing the information from their God into useful information and using it to aid their disciples.

Prophets have a direct connection to their God, allowing them to receive private messages from them.
They are also capable of transforming books into grimoires. 
However, their most powerful ability is their divine resurrection.

Prophets, fueled by their God's last amounts of immortal power, are able to resurrect after a minute delay upon dying.
At which point, they will be brought back to life and will gradually heal their wounds.
This resurrection can only be severed by a rival disciple using a grimoire or the chaplain using their bible (which functions as a non-aligned grimoire).

## Gods
The Gods are invincible observers that serve as the info source of each church. 
They can not be seen or heard by players, except for other Gods.
However, in exchange, they have a variety of abilities they can use in order to aid their followers in eventually completing the ascension ritual.

**Divinity** serves as a God's primary resource and is required in order to use their powers.
Gods themselves cannot create Divinity: it can only come from followers or from things happening on station.
In this sense, Divinity can come almost passively for some gods, due to how frequently some actions occur.

Divinity can be generated in a few ways:
- **Preaching:** Followers preaching from a grimoire of their God will create a small amount of divinity for every non-follower in range.
- **Altar Conversion:** Converting another church's altar will give you a boost in divinity. 
It will also decrease their amount of divinity. 
Be sure not to leave altars undefended.
- **Opposition Follower Sacrifice:** Sacrificing an opposing church's disciple, prophet, celestial artifact, or the station chaplain will give a significant amount of divinity.

On top of this, every god has two additional methods of generating Divinity.
The first, and easiest, is themed sacrifices. 
These are accomplished by simply offering specific items to an altar. 
Which item it is depends on the God.
The other method is a _divine task_.
These tasks are entirely nebulous and dependent on a God.

### Abilities
While the most interesting abilities vary from god to god, all gods share a few common abilities:
- **Word of God:** (no cost, ~1 minute cooldown) Send a message to your prophet.
- **Minor Blessing:** (low cost) Give a temporary speed, health, and armor buff to a target follower.
- **Minor Punishment:** (low cost) Damage and stun a target follower. 
Used to punish and make examples out of unruly followers.
- **Celestial Artifact:** (medium cost) When used on a target altar, spawns a random celestial artifact based on the God.
- **Major Blessing:** (medium cost) Grants the effects of Minor Blessing to all followers on-screen.
- **Proselytize:** (high cost) When used on a non-follower near an altar, converts them into a disciple.

Additionally, every God gets 3 unique abilities, 2 medium-cost and moderately strong ones and a single high-cost and extremely destructive attack.
The actual properties of these attacks vary from God to God, but they serve as simple ways to provide additional aid during battles or during the ritual.
