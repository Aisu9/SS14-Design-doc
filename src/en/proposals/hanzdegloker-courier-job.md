## Overview

There is a constant need, as in real life, for thing to be transported around the station from A to B. Whether that be precious materials from cargo
to science. Transporting the new mop sci made with the materials from cargo to the jani. Perhaps even the simplest of things, bringing an overworked
warden a bottle of whiskey from the bar. The courier would fufill the need of transporting important goods to the right place/person as well as being
a general helper to the station.

## Background

I have had cargotechs becoming discount couriers for me as a QM since sometimes A. people are too busy to pickup their orders or B. they forget and 
do not hear me over comms. Not to mention certain roles can be very busy and they themselves send out discount couriers! I have had borgs fufill this 
role for the RD, a security cadet was the steel boy for Sec. Now imagine if there was someone who's entire job was transportation of goods who could also
fufill a social role and be a general help to all departments? This is where I put foward the courier.

## Who is the courier?

I would like to touch on whom the courier is firstly, they are the kind of player that loves to help and interacting with people. The job necessitates 
talking to many people and of course helping allot of people. Perhaps while delivering the mail you come upon a crime scene! Perhaps while giving Sci 
their third stack of plasma this shift you help them choose a name for the Borg. Everybody loves a friendly neighborhood mailman, so how about a friendly
station-based courier?

## The meat and potatoes

Alright so what exactly is the fundamental purpose of the courier as a job?
