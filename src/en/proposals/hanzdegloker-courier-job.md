## Overview

There is a constant need, as in real life, for thing to be transported around the station from A to B. Whether that be precious materials from Cargo
to science. Transporting the new mop sci made with the materials from Cargo to the jani. Perhaps even the simplest of things, bringing an overworked
warden a bottle of whiskey from the bar. The courier would fufill the need of transporting important goods to the right place/person as well as being
a general helper to the station.

## Background

I have had Cargotechs becoming discount couriers for me as a QM since sometimes A. people are too busy to pickup their orders or B. they forget and 
do not hear me over comms. Not to mention certain roles can be very busy and they themselves send out discount couriers! I have had borgs fufill this 
role for the RD, a security cadet was the steel boy for Sec. Now imagine if there was someone who's entire job was transportation of goods who could also
fufill a social role and be a general help to all departments? This is where I put foward the courier.

## Who is the courier?

I would like to touch on whom the courier is firstly, they are the kind of player that loves to help and interacting with people. The job necessitates 
talking to many people and of course helping allot of people. Perhaps while delivering the mail you come upon a crime scene! Perhaps while giving Sci 
their third stack of plasma this shift you help them choose a name for the Borg. Everybody loves a friendly neighborhood mailman, so how about a friendly
station-based courier?

## The meat and potatoes

Alright so what exactly is the fundamental purpose of the courier as a job?

-Distrubuting goods ordered by Cargo to recipients

-Transporting goods between departments

-Delivering mail (packages and letters) between players

-Facilitating anykind of transportation of goods betwen players (giving a flower from sam to susie)

I would like to describe the courier's place in the job hierarchy as Cargo-lite, think of the lawyer. While they work very closely with Sec and even have
Sec comms and low level access they are not Sec fully. So the Courier would have low level access to Cargo, they can get inside but cannot approve orders, a
level of access below a Cargo tech. They will have access fully to the mail room if the station has it, as well as spawning with a Cargo headset to allow the
courier to work with Cargo to deliver goods. A courier will report to the HoP and be civilian in nature. 

## Tools of the trade

Two items I say will be needed to help the courier complete their duties and actually be seen as necessary, the janitor's no slips are vital to being "good" at their job
over the average joe as well as job defining so I took that as inspiration.

- The courier's bell: A bike bell that when used rings twice in rapid sucession, with a fairly long cooldown to prevent it being spammed or used for annoyance. The
intention of the tool is simple, to alert people of the courier's presence using a sound that is unmistakable and unique to the courier. Just as the sound of 
the ice cream truck bring the children to the street corner, so too will the sound the courier bell excite the RD as they know their plasma crate has arrivied.
This also stands as a form of verification, the courier's bell spawns on the persons of the courier and can only be obtained in that way, exactly like the boots of
the janitor. The courier's bell is a quick way to seperate a faker from a trusted deliverer of the mail as well as a quick way to notify usually busy folk that the 
mail is here!

- The courier's bag: Not to be mistaken as a stachel or backpack, the courier's bag goes into the belt slot and spawns on the courer already equipped when they spawn. This
indeed means the only way of getting this item too is from a courier. Now the intent of this item is to allow the courier to transport goods more effectively than your average
Joe. This bag is smaller than the chemistry bag but can hold materials, food, drinks and postal goods (Letters, packages, paper, folders and etc.) This allows couriers to 
move allot of good out of their satchels/backpacks/dufflebags to make more room for goods. Although being a packmule is not the intention, the intention is to get courier to favor
backpacks and satchels to skip the speed debuff of the duffle bag but still be able to carry quite allot to encourage speedy delivery of goods. 

## Additional content

While not necessary to the rolling out of the courier initially I feel like it completes them as a job, they are as follows:

- Letters that can hold up to 4 papers and be sealed. When sealed you write a "To" and a "From". They can be stamped after they are sealed, but once opened they are trash. 2x2 
grid inventory for inside the letter, the letter itself takes up 2x1 inside someone's inventory. Only paper can be placed inside.

- Packages that can be used to send any sort of items to people as gifts or just as a secure way to transport items. Just as the letters they would be sealed once everything you
want is inserted and you write a "To" and "From" on it. The package has no restriction on what can be inserted and has a 3x3 storage inside, while taking up 3x3 inside someone's
inventory. Packages can be stamped once sealed but not once opened, once opened they are trash. 

Both previous items give a certain depth to the job and flesh out the idea of mail and such, not to mention for the forgetful courier or just for convenience's sake the to and from tags
alongside stampability helps put trust in the courier that they aren't just, making mail up.

- Letter Hypos that are a syndicate item that is a one time use 10u injection method, the price I wouldn't know but I would make them destroy themselves on use. As they are one time use and
all so might as well give them some kind of buff besides being trustworthy.

- Package bombs are exactly what you think they are, small explosive syndicate items that when someone tries to open them they explode! Dealing the same damage of a explosive wet sign, but you
have the benefit that once it explodes it destroys itself and the only time it would detonate most likely is literally in the hands of the recipient. I can't say much on the topic of a price for 
such a syndicate item but I'd probably kin it to the explosive wet floor sign.
