# Botany helper gnomes

Have YOU ever needed to garden AND needed to grab a drink at the bar? 
Have YOU ever needed to fight mice on their own terf?
Do YOU need someone to save you when the air is poisoned but nobody can help?
Do _YOU_ need something to do once your soul is free floating and ready for harvest?

Never fear! Nanotransen Reaserch and Devopment brings you a breakthrough in both biotech and anomaly studies! 
THE GNOME! The best helper that botany can ask for! being small enough to get into those TIGHT spaces to do
tough jobs we gaurentee you will be happy* for their help.

(*Any defects are the responsibility of the station botanist)
(rumors of gnomes commiting Homicide are false and defamitory. There is no Gnome king)

# Overview
This design document adds a crafty and fragile ghost role tied to botany.

## Gnome features

 They are a ghost role For early to late round use,
 they have the following abilities and traits:
 - A hand slot to pick up items
 - they can drag items for storage (such as a survival box or backpack)
 - they can be picked up and worn as hats and die when thrown
 - they are healed and revived with glue
 - Gnomes are grown from a Gnome hat that can be planted into a gnome plant that grows the gnome
 - they are very fragile (10 health) but dont need air and are resistant to tempature damage 
 - being hollow they are weak to pressure changes that cause them to break quickly, space is an instant death.
 - can be gibbed into a gnome shard and glass to plant another gnome plant
 - has a gnome accent that replaces all g letters at the start of words to GN and certain past tence words to GNOMED eg: killed > GNOMED (The captain is GNOMED)
 - weak to blunt, slightly resistant to slash and peircing, and very resistant to burns
 - rooms can be "Gnome proofed" with mouse traps
 - Gnomes act like a normal garden gnome untill possesed by a ghost player

## Gnome Design And intent 
 
Gnomes are meant to be a way for players to create more ghost roles for dead players and offer new ways to help the station. 
The intent is for Gnomes to have good utility that leans twords being helpfull to the station and to add more variety of content to botany players. 
Gnomes while intended to be happy go lucky helpers have a very large potential for petty crime, this is balanced out in three ways:
 - very low health, if caught annoying crew or stealing or other activities they can be easily killed by whatever is on hand 
 - no inventory, everything must be held and containers cannot be dragged under doors meaning major theft has to be planned in advance 
 - cannot use guns 

Gnomes also may get annoying and demand server resourses if there are enough of them. currently 6 gnomes is the ideal normal max, although if botany tries very very 
hard they may make more than six. the idea is one Gnome per hat. being this limited however it would be simple for a greytide to round remove all of the gnomes. 
gnomes spawning a plantable gnome shard on death helps prevent gnomes from being removed from the round entirely.
The gnome hat will spawn as maints loot. 
Gnomes also may give a larger insentive to lock lockers so gnomes do not pilfer items (more important with syndicate gnomes as gnomes should NOT have an antag pass, 
petty crime is fine but sneaking into atmos and plasma flooding is NOT)
Gnomes are also grouned in humor, the limitations on them (low health and one hand with no inventory) would inspire ways to work around things. 
They have oportunities for strange gimmics but not much for anything actively harmfull. some examples of this Gremlin embracing idea are: 
hoarding, trading, stealing, fort construction, gnome maints bar, and so on. 

Idealy gnomes are useful helpers at best and crafty pests at worst

## traitor gnomes and non standard gnomes

After the helper gnome is implimented I will begin working on some of the following features to be added seprately.

Gnome types after The basic gnome are not very well thought out and will need a good amount of thought put into them. 
As it is thought of now a Trator will be able to call in a Gnome renforcement that a player can inhabit. they will have a specific red sprite to diferentiate gnome types.
the primary role of this gnome would be to do things stealthily for the agent. Gnomes and Syndicate gnomes would be given headset slots if this was implimented. they synicate gnome would keep the same 10 health and 
the headset and the gnome can be captured (gnomes do not require air thus they can be locked in a evidence locker or simply killed) 
Idealy this would add another layer onto stealth options for any agent, from gnome guided bombs (the gnome may refuse to be a bomb, that is up to the gnome) 
to a part of a complex planned heist. 

other types of gnomes would be mutated gnomes, using mutagen on a gnome plant would have a chance to mutate the plant into differnt types of gnome, 
be that a gnome that spills space lube when it dies, larger stronger gnomes, or gnomes that glow in the dark. 

additionaly gnomes have a potential for interesting mid round events. one example is gnomes that spawn out of vents or a gnome king that wishes to convert botany into a 
gnome kingdom to grow more gnomes (these would act like rat servants) 

## Special thanks
Here i would like to thank several people that helped get gnomes off the ground:
 - DanOftheE for making the sprites
 - Fey for letting me bounce ideas off them
 - mi$hka for asking me to make gnomes
   
While im responsible for development and design of the Gnomes without them i would have never done any of this.
