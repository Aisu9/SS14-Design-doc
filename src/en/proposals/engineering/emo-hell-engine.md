# Hell Engine [EmoGarbage, Unapproved]
*please don't bikeshed the name for the love of god*
### Abstract
The Hell Engine serves as a late-game engineering project able to serve as a method of bringing a lava-land like challenge to the entire station. It involves many different roles across several departments and could serve as an interesting central gimmick for a station as well as an end-goal for play.

## Construction
Primary construction of the Hell Engine initially depends on science. The construction of the engine itself requires emitters and two unique machines, the *Hell Engine Frame (Left)* and *Hell Engine Frame (Right)*. These will have to be unlocked through research in order to be able to create them from a circuit imprinter. This will not only serve as a "time gate" for bringing the dangerous machine on board, but will also create a progression that will work well as science's gameplay is refined.

Byond Science's involvement in researching the machines, rare materials such as silver, uranium, and gold will be needed from salvage in order to actually create the parts needed for the machine.

Finally, the operation of the Engine will create large amounts of heat, which will require a cooling system to be constructed by the engineering department in order to not create a catastrophic heating situation over time.

## Balance
The overall design of the Hell Engine is a balance between a highly lucrative environment combined with dangerous PVE threats that arise while the Engine runs

### Risk
The first risk that is immediately created from the Engine is a large amount of heat. This would require response from the Engineering department in order to create some kind of cooling loop and specialized containment for the Engine in order to facilitate it's operation on the station. Ideally, housing for it would **not be available** roundstart, so as to provide additionally challenges with the production of the Engine.

Another issue with it is power consumption, as it will consume more power while operating than could be easily produced via generators or by a single AME. This will induce a power-drain load that could cause issues if left running at a defecit for too long.

The third, and most proactive threat, is the Hell that the engine itself leads to. The core of the engine (pictured under 1 in the diagram above) is a portal that, when entered, transports the player to a different map, which contains a plethora of different threats including NPC enemies, dangerous alien artifacts, and high temperatures.

Escaping also provides a challenge, as exiting can only be done through select portals found sporadically throughout the zone.

### Reward
The first reward is rare ores. The walls of the world through the portal can be mined with a pickaxe. These can then be brought back to the station and used to facilitate more gameplay back on station.

The mobs of the world also provide a reward, as they can be harvested for both unique materials as well as meat which can be brought back on station. On a similar note, flora found there could have powerful medicinal properties and could be brought back on-station to be integrated with the botanist game loop.

The heat from the engine could additionally be harnessed by atmos techs and be used in the future to integrate with heat-based generators. This could provide a way to run the portal in a somewhat stable manner.

## Station Involvement
Medical: Medical crew could be tasked with providing supplies for people going through the portal. Paramedics could be tasked with jumping in to retrieve fallen salvage crew.

Security: In the event that an NPC horror wanders through a portal, Security would be tasked with eliminating it from wherever it spawned on station.

Clown: Imagine driving a clown car into the SM but actually funny.
