# Destructive Analysis [EmoGarbage, Unapproved]
You know it, you love it, you hate it: destructive analysis. Break this thing and reap the rewards of a king. But how do we make it good?

## The Rework
Turn destructive analysis from a way of generating points from a low-effort task (collecting random shit off the station) into a niche machine that can be used introduce new rare technologies into rounds.

In more simple terms, steal blatantly from Terraria's Journey Mode.

## The Stuff
### Rare Recipes
Currently, things like upper level machines parts and tools cannot be constructed. This is generally good for balance, as allowing these to regularly enter mass-production is likely to spell disaster for any semblance of balance.

Through Destructive Analysis, we can add an interesting tradeoff to this situation: if you're able to find multiple copies of a single rare item, you can destroy all of them to receive a tech disk with the recipe printed on it.

This provides a long-term reward for holding onto rare items, but can be balanced to be infrequent enough so that they do not regularly appear during rounds. 

For example, T4 machine parts can be made printable so long as you gather 5 of each type. In this way, you are not likely to receive enough to get the recipe every round, but there can rarely be instances where you are able to and can have an enjoyable experience.

### Enemy Equipment
A common issue during Nuke Ops rounds is that science is ineffective due to their inability to effectively interact with antagonists in a way that doesn't end with bullets holes perforating their bodies.

Destructive Analysis gives science a new role during these tense situations: the scavengers and suppliers of exotic/rare equipment. By getting the equipment from these antagonists, (nukie suits/guns, xeno parts, abductor tools) science can create their own versions, providing a new threat for careless antagonsists who leave their equipment (and teammates) behind.

### Chem Rework
What is this, a crossover? ~~Yes~~ Nope! Just a handy way for science to contribute.

Since this imagining of Destructive Analysis is quite niche, the destructive analyzer could be used to deconstruct equipment into materials and chems. 

This could be a good way to use extra equipment if materials are low on the station.

It also means that electronics can be decomposed into various otherwise rare chemicals. This means that science, which typically is bad at producing raw materials, can have a way to provide for chemistry.
