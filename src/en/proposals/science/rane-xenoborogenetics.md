# Xenorobogenetics [Rane, Unapproved, Unfinished]

Basically, add a department to science to experiment with turning people into horrific biomechanical monstrosities.

## Parts

### Sourcing
Parts can be printed or sourced from botany, salvage, hell, and so on. Outside of basic prosthetics, they are all sourced from stunned, specially captured mobs.

### Extractor
The main machine of xenorobogenetics, the extractor takes a stunned mob and extracts parts from it. 

### Traits
Each part has 3 traits: 1 good, 1 neutral, 1 bad.

## Surgical Experiments

The parts can be used in surgery at any time, but to earn research points, there will be a machine to request surgical experiments. It will suggest parts to implant into someone.

### Implanting
Implanting is done via normal surgery. When a part is implanted, it picks 2 of its 3 traits. The part is destroyed upon removal to prevent reroll cheese.
