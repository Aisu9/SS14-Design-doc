# Mapping sins
Don't do any of these. They make for bad looking/feeling maps.

## Ultra-wide hallways
So the thing about hallways is that they're empty.

This looks and feels bad to play in, with a very large amount of blank space visually.

### Ways to fix

#### Convert to a parkway
Filling the visual emptiness with plantlife or other decoratives helps significantly. This shouldn't be overdone, though, and it's preferrable to simply use smaller hallways.

## Abdundance of silver/gold tiles
To put it simply they look terrible, especially combined with decals, and should be used only in extremely specific situations.

### Ways to fix

#### Just change the theme
If you're using them to line a "rich feeling" room, say, the HoP's office, opt for instead focusing on a home-y feeling, with woods/etc. Most of the station simply does not have this feel and it'll make them seem exceptional.
